Make sure to download College Scorecard dataset from https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/. After download is completed, open `.zip` file and rename folder as `scorecard`. Move this folder to `data` before running `clean_data.R`.

Merged dataset for 2011-2020 available in `colleges.csv`. We can consider adding more variables to this dataset, too.
